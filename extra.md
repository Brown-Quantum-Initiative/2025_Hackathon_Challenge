## New Requirement: Package Management
🎉 Bruno Passed the First Midterm Check!

Congratulations to Bruno — and to everyone who helped him get this far! 🐻
⚛️

Your hard work and circuit wizardry have officially impressed Professor CNOTworthy (well... almost).

🧩
  There’s a Catch...

Sure, Professor CNOTworthy can be a bit much, but even a broken clock is right twice a day. 🕰️

He’s noticed that Bruno’s code for generating circuits isn’t using a standard package manager — and that’s a problem for reproducibility and documentation.

So, the Professor decided to “help” by adding two new files to the repository:

🗂️
 pyproject.toml

🔒
 uv.lock

These files now lock the Python environment to:

Python ≥ 3.12

Qiskit ≥ 2.2.3

This ensures consistent performance for both circuit optimization and visualization tools — no more mysterious version mismatches!

🧠
 Your Mission

Help Bruno make his repository fully reproducible by clearly documenting its key dependencies and using the uv
 package manager that Professor CNOTworthy swears by.

If you’re using Python, you are now required to use uv and build on the files that the Professor added.

If your project involves other programming languages (for frontends or visualization), don’t worry — the Professor only cares about reproducibility of the Python components.

📦
 Action Items:

Pull the latest changes from Bruno’s repo.

Learn about and install uv if you haven’t already.

Use it to manage dependencies and document your environment setup — it is very easy.

Make sure everything runs under Python 3.12+ and Qiskit 2.2.3+.

Bruno’s one step closer to becoming a professional quantum bear — help him make his code as solid and reproducible as his optimism! 🐻

## New Requirement: The Bruno Video Challenge!

🐻
Plot twist!
Just when Bruno thought things were finally stabilizing, Professor CNOTworthy decided to add one more challenge to truly test your creativity and teamwork.

Apparently, the Professor believes that “true quantum understanding requires artistic expression.”
So… brace yourselves for the next required task:

🎥
 The Bruno & Professor CNOTworthy Video Challenge

Every team must create a short video inspired by the story of Bruno the Bear and Professor CNOTworthy!
Be as creative and entertaining as you can — think mini-movie, mock interview, lab diary, musical, dramatic reenactment, anything! 🎭


Requirements:

The video must feature at least 2 people from your team.

You’ll earn bonus points if everyone makes a cameo appearance! 🌟


Keep it short and engaging (30 seconds to 1 minute is perfect).

You can record it on your phone, laptop, or any device — quality doesn’t matter as much as creativity.

You can use props and make use of the spaces we have given you access to in the APMA department.

You will have to show everyone your final video at the start of your presentation, no need to share or post it anywhere.


🏆
 Judging Criteria

Your video will be evaluated on:

Creativity – originality, humor, storytelling, and spirit.
Connection to the Bruno & Professor CNOTworthy narrative.

🎬
 So grab your teammates, hit record, and help tell the next chapter in Bruno’s Quantum Journey.

##  Modifier: A Quantum Error Correction challenge

😨
 Uh-oh… Professor CNOTworthy is getting suspicious.

Rumor has it the Professor suspects that Bruno might be getting outside help on his assignments (👀
 we wonder who that could be…). To keep Bruno safe from another impossible midterm, we all need to lay low for a while and make things look normal.

🕝
 At 3:15 PM — Send One Envoy to Room 217

Each team must quietly send one representative to the Mentor Room (217).
Also, no questions for the mentors will be allowed during this time.
While we “wait out” the Professor’s suspicions, something secret will happen there: a quantum error correction challenge where they will have to reason in multiple dimensions!

🤫
 Inside Room 217, your envoy will participate in a secret challenge that will affect the rest of the competition.

Important:
Once inside, your envoy will remain incommunicado — no contact with the rest of the team until the end of the quantum error correction challenge. The Professor must not suspect a thing! 🕵️‍♂️


 Instructions
Choose your envoy wisely.
Arrive promptly at 3:15 PM.
No messages, no leaks, no spoilers — secrecy is part of the test.

We await your envoy in Room 217. The fate of Bruno hangs in the balance… 🐻

## Modifier: The end-of-semester Final Presentation!

🎓
 It’s the end of the semester… and Bruno has to present his research!
After weeks in Professor CNOTworthy’s lab — visualizing circuits, optimizing qubits, surviving suspicion, and even shooting a short video — it’s finally time for Bruno’s big presentation. 🐻
✨


🎤
 The Final Research Showcase

Bruno will be taking the stage to defend his work in front of the entire department (and yes, Professor CNOTworthy is in the front row 👓
).

To help him out:

Each team may send up to 2  members to speak “on stage” on behalf of Bruno for the final presentation.

The remaining team members will serve as the Q&A crew, ready to answer questions from the audience and judges once the presentation ends. 💬


Remember your presentation needs to start with your video.

## Optional Sidequest: Bruno's Quantum Network 🐻⚛️

Bruno the Bear has realized that to land his dream career in quantum, he needs to grow his professional network — and fast! 🧠
💼


That’s where you come in. Help Bruno (and the Brown Quantum Initiative) spread the word about all the exciting quantum innovation happening at Brown by making a LinkedIn post about your participation in the 2025 Brown Quantum Hackathon.

Share what you’re working on — whether it’s visualizing quantum circuits or compiling them efficiently — and make sure to tag both the Brown Quantum Initiative and me (Alan Bidart) so we can track your post! Our collaborators at IBM would like you to use hashtags like #QiskitFallFest #QuantumComputing #IBMQuantum, but we will let you do whatever you want.

💡
 Rewards:

The participant whose post gets the most engagement (likes + 3 * comments + 10 * reposts) by the end of the hackathon will win a [redacted] 🎁


Let’s help Bruno build his quantum connections — and show the world the amazing work happening at Brown! ⚛️
