# Hackathon

Brown Quantum initiative
next year 24 hr

## Challenge

Quantum Compilation. How does a computer work? 
- GUI 
- high-level program languages 
- low-level program languages (Assembly) 
- machine code (binary) 
- hardware (physics).

For quantum computing, bottom-up
- the Hardware (physics)
- Qubit (superconducting loops, ions, topology) 
- Superposition & entanglement
- [Low-level (Quantum Assembly)]
- [High-level program language (Qiskit) (circuits)]
- GUI, APP, Browers

How to represent quantum program
- Classical gates
- [Quantum gatess]

Challenge: 
- How to visualize quantum circuits
